# C - Variables, if, else, while
## Basic C program

0-positive_or_negative.c: This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
The output of the program should be:
* The number, followed by
** if the number is greater than 0: is positive
** if the number is 0: is zero
** if the number is less than 0: is negative
** followed by a new line
1-last_digit.c: The output of the program should be:
* The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
** the string is, followed by
** if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
** if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
** if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
** followed by a new line
2-print_alphabet.c: a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar twice in your code
3-print_alphabets.c: program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar three times in your code
4-print_alphabt.c: program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

* Print all the letters except q and e
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar twice in your code
5-print_numbers.c: program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

* All your code should be in the main function
