### General Learning Objectives


* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

* All your files should end with a new line

* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

*  You are not allowed to use global variables

* No more than 5 functions per file

* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit.
Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden

* Allowed syscalls: read, write, open, close

* You are allowed to use [_putchar.c](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)

* You don’t have to push [_putchar.c](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c), we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function [_putchar.c](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c) should be included in your header file called main.h

* Don’t forget to push your header file

* All your header files should be include guarded

* Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (POSIX) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance read(STDIN_FILENO, ... vs read(0, ...
